# naoqi
  
This is code written by https://github.com/ros-naoqi  
Normally I would have you download from there, however, nao_msgs has moved to somewhere that I am unaware of.
This repo is a collection of the old repos we used to connect to the nao. To install, simply:   
```
git clone https://github.com/idkm23/naoqi.git  
cd naoqi  
catkin_make  
source devel/setup.bash     # not really necessary for installation, but if you are going to use  
                            # this as a dependency for another project then you will need to source before
```
